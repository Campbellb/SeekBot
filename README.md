# IntegrateHackathon2015

Seek is a bot that allows you to communicate with an Natural Language Processing Artificial Intelligence by text messaing in order to purchase plane tickets using the Sabre API.

It was a demo of the Sabre API, and the Ring Central API, and used the chatbots.io API as the chatbot.

Users communicated to the Chatbot, having a natural conversation. If the user said something like, "I need a vacation," or "I want to take a trip," Seek Bot would queue them up with the Sabre API interface.

Users could query the top 10 destinations they wanted to travel to, or could enter a price and Seek would tell them all of the possible destinations.
